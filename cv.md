## *About Me*
I started coding back in elementary school. The first language was Basi—Å and then Pascal. A few years later I started making the first sites using HTML.
Then I learned PHP and started making websites a little more complex. However, the main area of work and direction of training for me was system administration, and programming has remained my hobby.

Over the past 12 years, I have developed as a system administrator and network engineer applying my C# and Python programming skills to automate routine tasks.
I wrote a simple OpenSource utility to update DNS records in CloudFlare [zen-cf-ddns](https://github.com/DzenDyn/zen-cf-ddns).

During the pandemic, I had more free time and began to develop as a programmer and learn JS. I chose the Frontend direction, but also studied the Backend to get a general idea.

In the Backend, I worked with:
* Nodejs
* Express
* Nest
* OpenApi 3 and Swagger
* Mongoose + MongoDB
* TypeOrm
* PostgreSQL

In Frontend, I worked with:
* React and React Hooks
* Redux
* AntDesign

Now I want to systematize and deepen my knowledge in the direction of Frontend developer.
